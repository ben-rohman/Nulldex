		"biological father, her mother would simply smile and describe him as distant but kind, "
		"someone who didn't not belong to this world. \n\tOnce Sky reached adulthood, her mother "
		"grew ill. On her deathbed, she finally confessed: \n\t'Your father was Aether, god of "
		"the sky and radiant light. Before you were born, a prophecy was spoken, that his daughter "
		"would would rise to confront a soul thief, a being who could unravel life and death itself. "
		"If she failed, his power would weaken the gods thesmselves, leaving them helpless, and the "
		"world would descend into chaos. The gods became angry at Aether, blaming him for the threat "
		"they now faced, and forced him to return to the Heavens.' \n\tHer mother ended the story "
		"with a warning: some would fear her if they knew the truth. She made Sky to guard her "
		"secret carefully, sharing it only when absolutely necessary. \n\tYears passed. One night, "
		"a quiet stranger sat at the abr. He spoke of a dead friend, a buried magical experiment, "
		"and betrayal by someone he trusted. \n\t'If that's true,' Sky said, 'then the truth should "
		"come out, before something worse is created.' \n\tThe man studied her for a long moment, "
		"then paid her for his drinks and left. \n\tWeeks later, when the encounter with the man "
		"long forgotten and his face an empty, soulless void in her memory, a sudden wave of strange "
		"magic sweapt across the land. It rippled through the city, warpint memories, twisting minds, "
		"and shattering realities. \n\tSky felt the change immediately as a burning mark, glowing with "
		"radiant light appeared on her skin in the middle of the busy tavern. \n\tWord spread quickly. "
		"Whispers reached the nearby clergies, and soon they came, hunter her as both a threat and a "
		"key to the unfolding chaos. \n\tHer mother's final words rang in her ears, of Aether, the "
		"prophecy, and the soulless thief threatening the balance of life and death. \n\tSky fled "
		"her home, enemies at her door, and into the night. Carrying nothing but the weight of her "
		"divine heritage, she snuck onto a vehicle bound for the Wizard City. Following the whispers "
		"of the source of magical energy had originated there and filled with an uncertain hope that "
		"confronting her destiny might save the world... or doom it.\n\n";

		"and blessedly devoid of cloaked inquisitors or whispering pilgrims. \nShe stirred her tea "
		"absently, gaze flickering to the doorway at every creak. After about an hour her nervous "
		"glancing fell on a figure standing in the doorway. Panic rose in her throat as escape "
		"routes raced through her head. \nUntil the door swung shut behind the figure, revealing not "
		"one of the faithful nor a hunter but an awkward-looking young man with a journal too big "
		"for one pocket and a nervous, crooked smile. \nHe slid into the seat across from her "
		"without asking. \nSky's fingers tightened around her cup. 'You know people don't usually "
		"invite themselves to sit down without asking.' \n'Right. Sorry,' the man said quickly, "
		"adjusting the journal as if it were a shielf. 'I'm Ben.' Sky stared at him blankly in "
		"response. \n'I heard about what happened, what they're saying about you. The murderous "
		"Sorceress made of fire. Seeing as I'm not on fire right now, seems to be bullshit. "
		"Although your hair color is a bit unusual.' \nSky's stare somehow became more empty, "
		"'You know the murderous Sorceress part is true. Daughter of a god, burned a man's soul "
		"out that commented on my hair color.' Ben shifted in his seat nervously as Sky sipped her "
		"tea, her hollow eyes still fixed on him. '\nWell, I was kind of hoping that part was true. "
		"There's something happening to people, they're losing their memories or have unfamiliar "
		"ones. Some have gone catatonic and others have died.' \nSky's unnerving stare finally broke "
		"as she tilted her head at him. 'And what the fuck does that have to do with me? You want me "
		"to purify it with divine fire?' She mocked. '\nHe almost laughed. 'Honestly? I'm not even "
		"really sure what I'm asking. Just trying to get a group together that might be able to help "
		"stop what's coming. Maybe fix a few things in the process.' \nSky studied him more carefully "
		"now. There was a stubborn undertone in his weary voice. His hands were ink stained and unable "
		"to sit still. His eyes were sharp despite the dark circles under them. \n'You don't know me,' "
		"Sky said slowly. 'You dont know what I might do if something ancient and ugly tries to crawl "
		"into my head.' \nBen smiled slightly. 'That makes two of us.' \n'Sky leaned back and let out "
		"a dry chuckle. 'You're lucky I'm bored and have nowhere else to go.' \n'Ben's smile widened. "
		"'I'll take it.'\n\n";
